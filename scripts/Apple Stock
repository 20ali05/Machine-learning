Key Components:
- Project Overview: A brief description of the scriptâ€™s purpose, including financial analysis on Apple stock and its affiliates.
- Load Data: Load the dataset from a CSV file (apple_stock_data.csv) that contains daily stock prices.
- Data Preprocessing: Convert the Date column into a format compatible with Matplotlib (mdates.date2num), and extract the necessary columns (OHLC).
- Candlestick Chart: The script uses Matplotlib and candlestick_ohlc to generate a visual chart of the stock prices.
- Plot Customization: The x-axis is formatted to show dates, labels, and titles are set for clarity, and x-axis labels are rotated for easier readability.


Script Functionality:

This Python script processes financial data, formats it for visualization, and generates a candlestick chart for stock price analysis, useful in observing market trends.

You can use this script to analyze your dataset and build further insights such as moving averages, trend forecasts, or correlations between Apple Inc. and its partners.

If you'd like to automate creating different folders for storing results, models, or datasets, I can help with that too! Let me know what else you'd like to include.
